*Dag Heward-Mills Daily Devotional: 21st September “EVERYTHING BY PRAYER”*

READ: Luke 18:1-8

“Be careful for nothing; but in EVERY THING BY PRAYER and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.” – Philippians 4:6

Notice the above and the following biblical phrases: Everything by prayer! Praying always! Men ought always to pray! Pray always! Pray without ceasing!

PRAYING ALWAYS with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints; Ephesians 6:18

And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that MEN OUGHT ALWAYS TO PRAY, and not to faint; Luke 18:1

Watch ye therefore, and PRAY ALWAYS, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man. Luke 21:36 Pray without ceasing. 1 Thessalonians 5:17

Decide to pray about everything from today. Praying every day and praying about everything will change your life.

I can always tell when I meet people who do not pray much. You can tell the difference between pastors who pray and those who do not. There is an aura that you will not have when you do not pray. There is a blessing you will lack when you are prayerless. There is a supernatural element that is missing from your life when you are prayerless. There is some dryness that characterizes prayerless ministers and prayerless preachers.

Prayer is an expression of your faith. Prayer is speaking to somebody you cannot see. It is speaking to someone who never speaks back nor seems to answer immediately. To pray is to exercise great faith in the supernatural and the invisible! The supernatural feeling of God’s presence and the power of faith are always present on someone who prays a lot.
